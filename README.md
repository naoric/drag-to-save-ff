# Drag to Save for Firefox
Drag to save links to an offline Read Later list

I created this extension since I could not find anything that allows you to quickly and easily save links - 
only by right click, which I find very uncomfortable. 

This extension will save dragged links to an offline 'Read Later' list. 
There's much more to be done here, like:

- [x] Better indication when a new link is added to the list
- [ ] Integration with Pocket and other services
- [ ] Configuring matching URL patterns
- [ ] Prevent duplicate links
- [ ] Better UI

If you have more ideas, please open an issue.
